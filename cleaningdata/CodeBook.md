Repository of getting and clenaning data course project.

The repo contains:
 - run_analysis.R: the main script to perform the analysis. The analysis generates a tidy dataset 
                   from the original training and test datasets
 - /UCIHARDataset: folder with original training and test dataset from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
		   Version 1.0
 /outputDataset: folder with output data set generated by the analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run the analysis execute
source('run_analysis.r')

The run_analysis.R performs the following steps
 
  
 1) merge training and test dataset
 - read the features.txt and add column name to training and test original data set
 - prepare training dataset: from original training dataset (file UCIHARDataset/train/X_train.txt)  add subject_id column (file UCIHARDataset/train/subject_train.txt)
   and activity_id (file UCIHARDataset/train/y_train.txt) to generate traindataset.
 - prepare test dataset: from original test dataset (file UCIHARDataset/test/X_test.txt)  add subject_id column (file UCIHARDataset/test/subject_test.txt)
   and activity_id (file UCIHARDataset/test/y_test.txt) to generate testdataset.
 - merge all the measurement of the training dataset (traindataset)  with test dataset (testdataset) into a dataframe called mergedataset with all measurement.
 
 2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 
  - subset the features dataset with only variables that contains mean and std deviation in its names and store into featlabelms // 79 measurements expected
  - select the column in mergedataset by column index inside featlabelms -> result into mergemeands
 
 3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  - merge activity_labels.txt with mergemeands on activity_id labels -> generate mergemeandslb
 
 4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  This point is already resolved in step 1 cause it associates column names to original datasets.
  The dataset is mergemeandslb
 
 5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  Aggregate the dataset mergemeandslb grouping by activity and subject id and calculating the average of other variables. 
  It generates a file called outputdataset.txt

 Variables in output dataset
 Dimension of analysis
 1) Activity Id: id activity in range 1,2,3,4,5,6
 2) Activity label: activity label in list 
        1 WALKING
	2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	4 SITTING
	5 STANDING
	6 LAYING
 3) Subject Id: the subject id  who performed the activity for each window sample.	
 Measures of analysis
 Mean group by activity_id, activity_label and subject_id of  the following measures
